Event programming is programming that only takes places with the occurance of certain events, enabling the language to run asynchronous instead of line by line. 
***Q3. After completing the previous question, refer to the WikiPedia definition of [Event Driven Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming).  Provide any updates or revisions to your definition here:***
The defintion in wikipedia is very similar to the one stated above "event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads." 
***Q4. Provide a general description of the concept of an "Event":***
An event is any change that triggers a response in your code. 
***Q5. Provide some specific types of user interface interaction that JavaScript uses Events for:***
Javascript uses button clicks, mouse positions, sliders, switches, commands, sensors, and textual input from interfaces as events that 
trigger action. 
***Q6. What tools or techniques can be used to help developers debug JavaScript?***
Developers can use console.log, an online js-hint tool and other resources online to debug their code.
